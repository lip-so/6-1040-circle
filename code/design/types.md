# Circle types

Circle retains the existing Commons-only sign-in instances. Registering's local user
identity owns every note, need, graph, and suggestion. Request data never chooses
an owner. Source, target, need, and evidence bindings carry identities only.

```types
```

```instances
instantiate Registering

instantiate Federating as CommonsFederating with
  User is Registering.User

instantiate Sessioning with
  Subject is Registering.User

instantiate Remembering with
  User is Registering.User

instantiate Seeking with
  User is Registering.User

instantiate Graphing with
  User is Registering.User
  Source is Remembering.Memory

instantiate Connecting with
  User is Registering.User
  Target is Graphing.Entity
  Need is Seeking.Need
  Evidence is Graphing.Claim
```

The composition compares indexed evidence against current originals with the pure
[digest](computation:sourceDigest) operation. Both sides hash the exact UTF-8 content,
including original guided fields and Contact text; exclusion from provider input
happens after this digest, so changing any account content invalidates old evidence.

```computations
sourceDigest(content: String) : String
  Return lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 of the exact UTF-8 content without trimming, normalization, or line-ending replacement.
```
