# Seeking

## Purpose

Keep a user's ongoing needs available for reconsideration until resolved, including searches saved before the lifecycle existed.

## Principle

Sofia records a robotics research goal, refines it, and sees it remain active across visits. Resolving it stops reconsideration; reopening starts it again. A search saved before ongoing goals existed also appears as an ongoing need, and she can resolve it with one action.

## Types

```types
external User
```

## State

```state
a set of Needs with
  an owner User
  a description String
  an optional createdAt DateTime
  an optional active Flag

Rule: every new need has active true; application endpoints supply createdAt from the engine, while direct legacy invocations may omit it. A legacy need without active is interpreted as active and retains its original description and identity.
Rule: missing legacy createdAt remains unknown. Ordering never invents dates.
Rule: every mutation enforces owner membership within its atomic update. Unknown and other-owner needs have indistinguishable refusals or empty reads.
Rule: seek compares descriptions by trimming outer whitespace, collapsing each internal whitespace run to one space, and applying English-locale lowercase. Only normalized exact equality reuses a need; paraphrases are never merged. Legacy duplicate needs remain separate records.
Rule: reuse is guaranteed for sequential admitted invocations and the concept action queue in one assembly. Independent raw concurrent concept instances and multiple processes have no additional deduplication guarantee.
```

## Actions

```actions
seek(owner: User, description: String, createdAt?: DateTime) : returns (need: Need)
  where description is blank
  then
    refuses EMPTY_DESCRIPTION "The need description must not be blank."
  where description is not blank and at least one owned ongoing need has the same normalized description
  then
    bind the matching ongoing need with smallest identity in ascending identity order as need
    preserve its original description, createdAt, active interpretation, and every existing duplicate record
    returns need
  where description is not blank and no owned ongoing need has the same normalized description
  then
    create need with a new UUID identity, owner, exact supplied description, supplied createdAt if any, and active true
    treat explicitly resolved needs as nonmatching even when their descriptions normalize identically
    returns need

revise(owner: User, need: Need, description: String) : returns ()
  where need is not in Needs or need.owner is not owner
  then
    refuses NEED_REVISION_UNAVAILABLE "This goal is not available."
  where need is in Needs and need.owner is owner and need.active is false
  then
    refuses NEED_REVISION_INACTIVE "Reopen this goal before editing it."
  where need is in Needs and need.owner is owner and need.active is not false and description is blank
  then
    refuses EMPTY_NEED_REVISION "The need description must not be blank."
  where need is in Needs and need.owner is owner and need.active is not false and description is not blank
  then
    replace description and preserve need identity and createdAt
    leave an identical description unchanged
    returns

resolve(owner: User, need: Need) : returns ()
  where need is not in Needs or need.owner is not owner
  then
    refuses NEED_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE "This goal is not available."
  where need is in Needs and need.owner is owner
  then
    set active to false, leaving an already inactive need unchanged
    returns

reopen(owner: User, need: Need) : returns ()
  where need is not in Needs or need.owner is not owner
  then
    refuses NEED_REOPEN_UNAVAILABLE "This goal is not available."
  where need is in Needs and need.owner is owner
  then
    set active to true, leaving an already active need unchanged
    returns

delete(owner: User, need: Need) : returns ()
  where true
  then
    atomically remove the need only when it belongs to owner
    leave an absent or other-owner need unchanged with the same successful result
    repeating deletion succeeds unchanged and can trigger owner-scoped downstream cleanup
    returns
```

## Queries

```queries
_get(owner: User, need: Need) : optional (description: String)
  Answer owner's need description.
  Answer no row for an unknown need or another owner's need.

_record(owner: User, need: Need) : optional (description: String, active: Flag)
  Answer owner's need description and active status, interpreting absent legacy active as true.
  Answer no row for an unknown need or another owner's need.

_list(owner: User) : many (need: Need, description: String, active: Flag)
  Answer all owner's needs, interpreting absent legacy active as true.
  Answer no rows when owner has no needs.
  Order dated needs by createdAt descending then identity ascending, followed by undated legacy needs by identity ascending. This exposes the latest created searches first without inventing dates for older records.

_active(owner: User) : many (need: Need, description: String)
  Answer only owner's needs whose active field is not false, including legacy needs without that field.
  Answer no rows when owner has no active needs.
  Order by createdAt descending then identity ascending, placing undated active needs last by identity.
